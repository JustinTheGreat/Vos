# VOS
## About VOS
VOS is a concept where we are able to leverage third party applications to centralize it all onto one application to allow a user to be able to replicate themselves. We aim to create an accessible software for users to be able to create more accurate memories for themselves and to help preserve their history.

## How it works
We take in the user's voice, memories/reflections, and allow train an AI model to allow it to mimic the user's thought actions. On top of this, we take leverage the 2d photos by users to try and create an AI model which allows users to be able to see themselves in a more realistic version of themselves.
